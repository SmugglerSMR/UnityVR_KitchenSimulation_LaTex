	abstract={Virtual environments have a role to play in facilitating the acquisition of living skills in people with intellectual disabilities, improving their cognitive skills and providing them with entertainment. However, the currently recommended devices to allow navigation in and interaction with the environments are difficult to use. Using a methodology established in an earlier study, the study aims to systematically document the performance of users with the currently recommended devices in order to (i) inform the design of a usable control device or devices and (ii) act as a baseline against which they can be evaluated. 40 people with severe intellectual disabilities aged 21-67 years used four environments with an equal number of sessions with the different devices being evaluated. Results indicate that when forward movement is provided by the software using the mouse for both navigation and interaction allows better performance both initially and after exposure than using the fire button on the joystick. When the user had to initiate forward movement with the navigation device, the joystick allowed better performance than the arrows on the keyboard. Preventing slippage of the joystick base would make its use much easier and it is suggested that separate devices are retained for navigation and interaction.;Virtual environments have a role to play in facilitating the acquisition of living skills in people with intellectual disabilities, improving their cognitive skills and providing them with entertainment.

	abstract = "Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are in need of effective physical fitness training programs. The aim was to test the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality (VR)-based exercise program in improving the physical fitness of adults with IDD. A research group (N=30; mean age=52.3±5.8 years; moderate IDD level) was matched for age, IDD level and functional abilities with a control group (N=30, mean age=54.3±5.4 years). A 5–6 week fitness program consisting of two 30min sessions per week included game-like exercises provided by the Sony PlayStation II EyeToy VR system. Changes in physical fitness were monitored by the Energy Expenditure Index (EEI), the modified 12min walk/run and the Total Heart Beat Index (THBI). Significant (p<0.05) improvements in physical fitness were demonstrated for the research group in comparison to the control group for the Modified Cooper test and the THBI but not for the EEI test. The EEI, Modified Cooper and THBI tests were found feasible to evaluate physical fitness levels and change of individuals with IDD under clinical conditions. VR technology intervention was suitable for adults with IDD and resulted in significant improvements in the physical fitness levels of the participants."

	abstract = {This paper presents some lessons learnt from the co-creation, within a support organisation, of a virtual world dedicated to practicing life skills for people with intellectual disability. The progression of the project throughout successive stages has indicated what people would want to see and practice in a such a virtual world, which would not have been found after a single development iteration. These desires include the representation of public spaces, social interactions and disruptions. Based on initial trials, we propose some new design insights for further implementation of such virtual worlds in training sessions with the use of immersive headsets. While immersive headsets have been demonstrated to enhance the learning experience, they also visually isolate the person in training from the trainer. To overcome this isolation, a new design concept is presented which allows the teacher to communicate, using gestures, with the immersed student.},
